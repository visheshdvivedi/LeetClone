- **Judge0** (for code execution)

### Steps

#### Step 1: Clone the repository
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/visheshdvivedi/LeetClone.git
cd leetclone
```

#### Step 2: Backend Setup (Django)

1. Navigate to the backend folder

```cmd
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies
```cmd
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup environment variables by creating a `.env` file and fill the following details:
```
BASE_API_URL=https://localhost:8000
BASE_APP_URL=https://localhost:5173/
DEBUG=True

GOOGLE_OAUTH_BACKEND_REDIRECT_URL=https://localhost:8000/api/v1/login/google/
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<google auth client id>
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<google auth client secret>
GOOGLE_OAUTH_FRONTEND_REDIRECT_URL=https://localhost:5173login/google

JUDGE_URL=<local judge0 instance url>

PGDATABASE=<database name>
PGHOST=<pg hostname>
PGUSER=<pg user>
PGPASSWORD=<pg password>
PGPORT=5432
```

5. Apply migrations 
```cmd
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

6. Create sample problems in database (optional)
```cmd
python3 manage.py createproblems problems_list.json
```

7. Run backend server
```cmd
python3 manage.py runserver
```

#### Step 3: Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder

```cmd
cd frontend
```

2. Install the required dependencies
```cmd
npm install
```

3. Run the React development server
```cmd
npm run dev
```

#### Step 4: Setup Judge0 (Self Hosted)
- Follow the [Judge0 documentation ](https://github.com/judge0/judge0) to install and configure a self-hosted instance.
- Update the backend settings to point to your Judge0 instance for code execution.

#### Accessing the application
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
